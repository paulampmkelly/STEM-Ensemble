Raspberry Pi Hat that takes the pi audio out signal, passes it through an envelope detector and then the output of the envelope detector is sampled by an ADC which can then be read by the pi.
There is also a 3 way JST connector for connecting to the mouth servo. This way the mouth can move in a semi-realistic way while the pi plays speech via its audio out jack.
